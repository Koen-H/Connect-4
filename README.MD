- When your enemy gets disconnected, a randomizer will take over.

## Not supported / bugs
- As of right now, you can join lobbies that are already active. This is not supported and will cause the game to desync.
- Sometime a lobby shows up that doesn't actually exist

## Roadmap
- Custom board rules (Width, height, minimum connect, coins drop per turn)
- Sound
- Better team manager
- Better UI and more user feedback of players leaving/getting unexpectedly disconnected
